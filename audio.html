      <br>[00:00:14] There ain't no gold in this river
      <br> That I've been washin' my hands in forever
      <br> I know there is hope in these waters
      <br> But I can't bring myself to swim
      <br>When I am drowning in this silence
      <br>Baby, let me in
      <br>Go easy on me, baby
      <br>I was still a child
      <br>Didn't get the chance to
      <br>Feel the world around me
      <br>I had no time to choose
      <br>What I chose to do
      <br>So go easy on me
      <br>There ain't no room for things to change
      <br>When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
      <br>You can't deny how hard I've tried
      <br>I changed who I was to put you both first
      <br>But now I give up
      <br> Go easy on me, baby
      <br> I was still a child
      <br>Didn't get the chance to
      <br>Feel the world around me
       <br> Had no time to choose
      <br> What I chose to do
      <br> So go easy on me
      <br>I had good intentions
      <br>And the highest hopes
        <br> But I know right now
      <br> It probably doesn't even show
      <br> Go easy on me, baby
      <br>I was still a child
      <br>I didn't get the chance to
      <br>Feel the world around me
      <br>I had no time to choose
      <br>What I chose to do
      <br>So go easy on me
